Title: Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient Test
Author: Thorsten Pohlert
Maintainer: Thorsten Pohlert <thorsten.pohlert@gmx.de>
Description: Calculates the Probability Plot Correlation Coefficient (PPCC) 
             between a continuous variable X and a specified distribution. The corresponding 
	     composite hypothesis test that was first introduced by 
	     Filliben (1975) <doi: 10.1080/00401706.1975.10489279> 
	     can be performed to test whether the sample 
	     X is element of either the Normal, log-Normal, Exponential,
	     Uniform, Cauchy, Logistic, Generalized Logistic, Gumbel (GEVI), Weibull,
	     Generalized Extreme Value, Pearson III (Gamma 2), Mielke's Kappa, Rayleigh
	     or Generalized Logistic Distribution. The PPCC test is performed with
	     a fast Monte-Carlo simulation.
